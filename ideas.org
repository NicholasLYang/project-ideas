#+TITLE: Project Ideas

Just a bunch of project ideas that I have

- ChanceMe
  - Idea: Help high school students find colleges that fit their needs, budget, and scores
  - Stack: React/Rails
  - Progress: Working to MVP
- SiteSpite
  - Idea: Complain about bad sites, bugs, stupid changes, etc.
  - Stack: Phoenix/ReasonML (planned)
  - Progress: Preliminary work
- GraphQL Framework
  - Idea: Minimalist framework centered around GraphQL, Rails-esque ease of use minus Rails bloat.
  - Stack: TBD
  - Progress: None
